# CSCE-470-Project

# Backend Setup

To run the back end of this project, follow these steps:

1. Change the current directory to the "BE" (Back End) folder:
   ```bash
   cd BE
2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
3. Start the backend
    ```bash
    python3 api.py

This will launch the backend server, located at http://127.0.0.1:8000. So if you want to call the "hello" endpoint, you would call it via http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello


# Frontend Setup

To run the front end of this project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have node.js installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download

1. Change the current directory to the "FE" (Front End) folder:
   ```bash
   cd FE
2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
3. Start the frontend
    ```bash
    npm start

This will launch the development server, and your front end application will be accessible in your web browser at a specified URL, typically http://localhost:3000.
