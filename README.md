# Front End Setup

To run the front end of this project, follow these steps:

1. Change the current directory to the "FE" (Front End) folder:
   ```bash
   cd FE
2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
3. Start the frontend
    ```bash
    npm start

This will launch the development server, and your front end application will be accessible in your web browser at a specified URL, typically http://localhost:3000.
